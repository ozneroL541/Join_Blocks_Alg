## Description
This program simulates different algorithms in order show how many steps they take to calculate the cartesian product between two tables.
The program is parametrical respect the tables, R and S and the size of the buffer.
The size of the buffer must be bigger then 3 and it's consider only to perform multi-block algorithms, 
for the others it's considered 3 block.

## Download
Download the source code from Github

    git clone https://github.com/ozneroL541/Join_Blocks_Alg.git

## Compilation
> It is suggested to use ICX Intel Compiler to compile this program, if it is not avaiable, GCC will be used.

To compile run:

    make

## Execution
To execute the program run
```
bin/blocks <R table blocks> <S table blocks> <Buffer blocks>
```
